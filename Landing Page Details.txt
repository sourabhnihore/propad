HERO SECTION (Above the fold)
Primary Hook (Big, bold)

Capture now. Decide later.

Sub-headline (1–2 lines)

Propad is a calm execution memory that protects unfinished intent — and brings it back when it actually matters.

Not tasks.
Not notes.
Not reminders.

Emotional Reinforcement (small text)

Stop losing things you cared about — just because you weren’t ready yet.

🌊 SOCIAL CONTEXT (Why this exists)

Most productivity tools help you execute.

But execution isn’t the real problem.

The real problem is everything you meant to come back to —
and quietly forgot.

Propad exists for that gap.

😵‍💫 THE PROBLEMS (Very relatable, scroll-stopping)
Problem 1: Intent decays faster than information

You save things like:

“Follow up once they reply”

“Do this later”

“Idea worth revisiting”

“Remember this workaround”

But then:

Notes get buried

Tasks demand decisions too early

Reminders need dates you don’t have

Result: Silent forgetting — not visible failure.

Problem 2: Productivity tools ask for clarity too early

Most tools assume you know:

What to do

When to do it

How to do it

Real life?
You often know only one — or none.

So you either:

Don’t save it

Or save it and never see it again

Problem 3: Reminders create noise, not clarity

Too many reminders → you ignore them
Too few reminders → intent rots

The problem isn’t reminders.
It’s timing.

💡 THE CORE INSIGHT (Your moat)
Headline

Unfinished intent deserves protection, not pressure.

So instead of pushing you to decide…

Propad:

Accepts incomplete thoughts

Tracks uncertainty silently

Waits patiently

Resurfaces with context — not commands

No stress.
No guilt.
No false urgency.

🧩 HOW PROPAD WORKS (Simple, calming)
1️⃣ Capture anything — instantly

Dump:

Half-baked ideas

Conditional thoughts

“Later” intentions

No labels.
No dates.
No task creation.

2️⃣ Propad understands incomplete intent

Behind the scenes, Propad detects:

Partial intent

Conditional intent (“once”, “after”, “if”)

Dormant knowledge

Stale intent

You never see complexity — only clarity.

3️⃣ Gentle resurfacing (not reminders)

When forgetting becomes likely, Propad checks in:

What it was

Why it mattered

What’s missing

Then offers options — never commands.

🔁 PROBLEMS → SOLUTIONS (Very scannable)
Your Problem	How Propad Helps
“I don’t know when”	Propad waits and checks later
“I don’t know how”	Context is preserved
“I’ll do it later”	The why is remembered
Too many reminders	Rare, meaningful resurfacing
Notes get buried	Intent is revived
🌱 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES (This is conversion gold)
🟢 Example 1 — Conditional Follow-up

You save:
“Follow up once they reply”

Later, Propad says:
“You saved this 7 days ago. Still waiting on a reply. Want to keep watching or act now?”

🟢 Example 2 — Half-Baked Idea

You save:
“Idea for content about AI agents”

Later, Propad says:
“You noted this earlier. Still worth exploring?”

No pressure. Just memory.

🟢 Example 3 — Knowledge Without Timing

You save:
“Workaround for X bug”

Later:
“You’ve seen a similar issue before. Want to revisit this workaround?”

🟢 Example 4 — Professional Work

You save:
“Need to inform client after deployment”

Later:
“Deployment seems done. Do you want to inform the client now?”

🚫 WHAT PROPAD IS NOT (Trust-building)

Propad is not:

A task manager

A calendar

A planner

A chatbot

A productivity dashboard

It doesn’t try to manage your life.
It just remembers what mattered.

🧘 EMOTIONAL PAYOFF (Why users stay)

Using Propad feels like:

Less anxiety

Less mental load

Less guilt

More control

The feeling users describe:

“I don’t have to hold everything in my head anymore.”

That’s the habit.

🎯 FINAL POSITIONING STATEMENT

Propad helps you keep track of what mattered —
even when you weren’t ready to act yet.
